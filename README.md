# Screeps-Observer-Public
Screeps Observer is an unofficial client for Screeps for iOS.

The main repo is not open source at this time but issues with the app can be reported here.

Current features (list may not be complete):
- Room/map viewing:
  - Rooms are viewed in the context of the map, zoom into a room on the map and it switches to the detailed room view with the map level detail rooms still surrounding it. Zoom back out and it switches back to map detail.
  - Map stats with more options than the main client (Example: show owner, mineral, and claimable all at the same time)
  - View room details by tapping a room on the map (supposed to show same or more info than when hovering over a room on the map in the main client)
  - View object details by tapping a room object (Some details are probably missing but the intent is to show all the same info or more than the side bar shows when clicking an object in the main client)
  - Type a room name to jump to that room

  - Save multiple private servers and connect to your server of choice with one tap.
